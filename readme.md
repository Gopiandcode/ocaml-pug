# OCaml-Pug 

> OCaml-Pug is a parser/compiler for a pug-like language in pure OCaml

Essentially, no need to run node or any other JS shenanigans, while
still being able to quickly prototype HTML.


Examples:

```pug
html
  body
    h1 Title
```

becomes:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Title</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
